## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our software, we highly encourage you to report it to us so that we can address the issue promptly and ensure the safety of our users. This section outlines the necessary steps to report a vulnerability, the expected response time, and what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined.

### Where to Report a Vulnerability
To report a security vulnerability, please submit your findings through our dedicated Vulnerability Reporting Email with Subject "[ Vulnerability Report ]" (**Please do not send irrelevant email**). You can write all the relevant information, including a detailed description of the vulnerability, potential impact, and any steps necessary to reproduce the issue.

Email: rliu493@uwo.ca

**Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly or share it with third parties before we have had a chance to investigate and address the issue.**

### Response Time
Upon submission of your vulnerability report, you will receive an email confirming that we have received your report in 48 hours. Our security team will then review the information provided and perform an initial assessment of the vulnerability. We aim to respond to all reports within 72 hours.

Please note that the response time may vary depending on the severity of the issue and the complexity of the investigation. We will, however, make sure to keep you informed throughout the process and provide regular updates on the status of your report.

### What to Expect If the Vulnerability Is Accepted or Declined
If your reported vulnerability is accepted, our security team will work diligently to address the issue and implement necessary security measures. You will be kept informed of the progress and any relevant details, such as the expected resolution timeline and any patches or updates that are made available. Once the issue has been fully resolved, we may publicly acknowledge your contribution in a security advisory or similar publication, with your permission.

If your reported vulnerability is declined, it may be due to various reasons, such as the issue being a known or low-severity vulnerability, or it may not meet our security criteria. In such cases, we will provide you with a clear explanation of why the vulnerability was declined, and if applicable, suggest any alternative steps or further research that you may wish to pursue.

We greatly appreciate your contribution to the security of our software and services. Your responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities helps us maintain a secure environment for all users and ensures the ongoing safety and trust in our products.
